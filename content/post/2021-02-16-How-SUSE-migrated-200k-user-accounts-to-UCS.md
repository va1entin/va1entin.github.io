title: 'Talk: How SUSE migrated 200k user accounts to UCS'
---
During my time as a Consultant & Engineer with [Univention](https://univention.com), I supported Daniel Schmidt and his colleagues at [SUSE](https://suse.com) in their migration of 200k user accounts from a legacy identity management to [Univention Corporate Server](https://univention.com) (UCS).

It was a live migration over the course of weekend and I provided technical consulting as well as live patches and enhancements to UCS for issues and areas of improvements which were found during the migration.

During this year's virtual Univention Summit, Daniel presented that story in a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-NY9JCz6VA) which I'd like to share with you. The talk is in German and - at this point - has no English subtitles.

Thanks a lot for the kudos @18:11 to you, Daniel! :)

I've had a great time working with you and your team. Best wishes from Bremen!
