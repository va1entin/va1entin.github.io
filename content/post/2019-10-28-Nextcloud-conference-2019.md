title: Providing access to thousands of external storages using Nextcloud
---
A few weeks ago I've held a talk involving a solution I've built @[univention](https://univention.com) for a customer using Univention Corporate Server and Nextcloud at this year's Nextcloud conference.

The talk is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjLiSL_XYvs&t=1766).

The documentation for the cool solution I'm referring to in the talk can be found in the [Univention Knowledge Base](https://help.univention.com/t/cool-solution-mount-samba-shares-in-nextcloud/).

Thanks a lot to the folks at Nextcloud and especially [Nina](https://twitter.com/nlapalice) and [Jos](https://twitter.com/jospoortvliet) for the invitation and great discussions!
