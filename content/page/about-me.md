I worked with GitHub's largest Enterprise clients in Europe on their AI and DevSecOps journey across the software development lifecycle from first talks and comprehensive demos through keynotes at internal conferences and security + legal talks with highly regulated industry teams to roll-out and adoption workshops as well as participation in beta programs and collaboration with product and engineering teams.

Having joined a week before GitHub Copilot Business went GA, I was privileged to work mostly on engagements focused on AI-empowered software development.
