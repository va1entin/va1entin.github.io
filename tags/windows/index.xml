&lt;p>&lt;strong>AutoDarkMode&lt;/strong> is a great open source tool to automatically switch between dark and light themes on Windows. You can set custom hours, switch manually or use sunset and sunrise from your location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download it and contribute &lt;a href="https://github.com/AutoDarkMode/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode">here on GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can also change your wallpaper to a light or dark one - &lt;em>but only on one screen&lt;/em>. Since I have a dual screen setup and a soft spot for ultra-wide wallpapers, there had to be a way!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workaround for broken DNS in WSL2</title><link>https://valh.io/p/workaround-for-broken-dns-in-wsl2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 12:34:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://valh.io/p/workaround-for-broken-dns-in-wsl2/</guid><description>&lt;p>WSL2 uses the Windows host&amp;rsquo;s DNS - so if DNS is working on Windows, normally WSL2 should be fine as well! Unfortunately, DNS in WSL2 just randomly stopped working for me at some point. The &lt;code>/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code> file generated by WSL2 was still being correctly created but DNS just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily there are plenty of ways to work around this, because we can just do DNS ourselves inside the Linux running in WSL2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fix silently failing Docker Desktop upgrade (Windows)</title><link>https://valh.io/p/fix-silently-failing-docker-desktop-upgrade-windows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 12:22:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://valh.io/p/fix-silently-failing-docker-desktop-upgrade-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>Docker Desktop has an internal update mechanism which will, as soon as an update is available, begin asking you to apply it on every start. Unfortunately this update mechanism is not working properly for me and other users. Once you allow Docker Desktop to run the update with admin privileges nothing seems to happen and Docker also doesn&amp;rsquo;t start properly until you restart it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cause seems to be some kind of privilege problem with the Docker service running in the background. Here is a workaround that works nicely for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sync system time automatically at Windows startup</title><link>https://valh.io/p/sync-system-time-automatically-at-windows-startup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 17:22:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://valh.io/p/sync-system-time-automatically-at-windows-startup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: The Windows time sync service is not working reliably. It was working fine on my system for a few months but stopped syncing time properly eventually even though it is still being started automatically. Feel free to give it a try nonetheless but know that this seems to be another one of Windows&amp;rsquo; great unreliable mysteries&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike most other operating systems, Windows 10 doesn&amp;rsquo;t sync the time with an internet service at startup by default. This can become an issue, if your mainboard&amp;rsquo;s built-in clock provides a wrong time or uses a different time zone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating CPU load on Windows</title><link>https://valh.io/p/generating-cpu-load-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 17:27:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://valh.io/p/generating-cpu-load-on-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently wanted to check, if there was a problem with my CPU under heavy load, when running on Windows. For such purposes &lt;a href="http://download.sysinternals.com/files/CPUSTRES.zip">CPUSTRES.exe from the Sysinternals suite&lt;/a> is very helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CPUSTRES is a handy little tool to check your process for faults on heavy load.
It comes with a simple GUI and allows you to instantly put heavy CPU load on your system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CPUSTRES comes as a simple standalone program with a GUI and 4 threads to activate. You can also assign different intesities per thread. Task manager helps checking how much load is actually put on the CPU.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
