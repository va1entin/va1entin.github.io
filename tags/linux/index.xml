      <title>Workaround for broken DNS in WSL2</title>

      <description>WSL2 uses the Windows host&amp;rsquo;s DNS - so if DNS is working on Windows, normally WSL2 should be fine as well! Unfortunately, DNS in WSL2 just randomly stopped working for me at some point. The /etc/resolv.conf file generated by WSL2 was still being correctly created but DNS just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Luckily there are plenty of ways to work around this, because we can just do DNS ourselves inside the Linux running in WSL2.</description>

      <description>Setup InfluxDB test instance with Docker docker run -d -p 8086:8086 --name influxdb influxdb This command pulls the latest InfluxDB image from Docker Hub, runs it with the name influxdb and makes the default port 8086 available on localhost. Once the container is up and running, we need to setup InfluxDB before we can use it.
Open a shell in the InfluxDB container:
docker exec -it influxdb bash Start the interactive setup wizard by running influx setup.</description>

      <description>During my time as a Consultant &amp;amp; Engineer with Univention, I supported Daniel Schmidt and his colleagues at SUSE in their migration of 200k user accounts from a legacy identity management to Univention Corporate Server (UCS).
It was a live migration over the course of weekend and I provided technical consulting as well as live patches and enhancements to UCS for issues and areas of improvements which were found during the migration.</description>

      <title>Python script for Cloudflare DNS record updates (DynDNS)</title>
      <link>https://valh.io/p/python-script-for-cloudflare-dns-record-updates-dyndns/</link>

      <description>Note: This is an update to a post from 2019 and features a rewrite in Python with various new features including IPv6 support, logging, argument parser, &amp;hellip;
Why I&amp;rsquo;m using Cloudflare as CDN and DNS provider as well as domain registrar. For a system with an external IPv4 address that changes daily I needed a way to dynamically update a DNS record at Cloudflare with the system&amp;rsquo;s current external IP address.</description>

      <title>Simple CLI audio metadata editor: tag_dat.py</title>
      <link>https://valh.io/p/simple-cli-audio-metadata-editor-tag_dat.py/</link>

      <description>Audio metadata is often not particularly easy to manage in a simple and quick manner. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of tools providing this feature but many of them have a ton of other additional functionality or are full-on music library managers. I wanted a very simple command-line tool to quickly change the title, artist and album tags of audio metadata - the result is &amp;ldquo;tag_dat.py&amp;rdquo; and available in my tools repository.
tag_dat.py iterates over a file or all files in a given path (default: current path), sets the filename (without file ending) as title and given arguments album and artist as audio tags.</description>

      <title>Get Ledger Live working on NixOS</title>

      <description>The Ledger Nano series are hardware wallets for crypto currencies. They&amp;rsquo;re managed through an application called Ledger Live. Ledger Live runs on linux but might - depending on your distro - require some adjustments in order to correctly identify the device via USB. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t test whether this config works with all Ledger devices so far. Feel free to drop me a tweet if you have anything to add to this post and I&amp;rsquo;ll gladly update it.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve held a talk involving a solution I&amp;rsquo;ve built @univention for a customer using Univention Corporate Server and Nextcloud at this year&amp;rsquo;s Nextcloud conference.
The talk is available on YouTube.
The documentation for the cool solution I&amp;rsquo;m referring to in the talk can be found in the Univention Knowledge Base.
Thanks a lot to the folks at Nextcloud and especially Nina and Jos for the invitation and great discussions!</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve held a talk involving a solution I built @univention for a customer using Univention Corporate Server and Nextcloud at this year&amp;rsquo;s Nextcloud conference. The video of that will probably be available in the next few weeks and I&amp;rsquo;ll share it here once it&amp;rsquo;s available.
UPDATE: See here for the video of the talk.
Another interesting thing regarding Nextcloud and UCS happened in the meantime though: The Nextcloud app for UCS now comes with pre-configured Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML.</description>

      <title>Setting up unattended upgrades on Debian</title>

      <description>Why I have a Raspberry Pi running on Raspbian in my home network. It mainly provides a DNS server based on Pi Hole and runs some cronjobs for me. Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t want to login to such a system regularly and install package upgrades. That&amp;rsquo;s where unattended upgrades come into play. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to set unattended upgrades up on Debian and walk you through some config parameters that I find very useful.</description>
