Unfortunately, DNS in WSL2 just randomly stopped working for me at some point. The &lt;code>/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code> file generated by WSL2 was still being correctly created but DNS just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily there are plenty of ways to work around this, because we can just do DNS ourselves inside the Linux running in WSL2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fix silently failing Docker Desktop upgrade (Windows)</title><link>https://valh.io/p/fix-silently-failing-docker-desktop-upgrade-windows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 12:22:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://valh.io/p/fix-silently-failing-docker-desktop-upgrade-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>Docker Desktop has an internal update mechanism which will, as soon as an update is available, begin asking you to apply it on every start. Unfortunately this update mechanism is not working properly for me and other users. Once you allow Docker Desktop to run the update with admin privileges nothing seems to happen and Docker also doesn&amp;rsquo;t start properly until you restart it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cause seems to be some kind of privilege problem with the Docker service running in the background. Here is a workaround that works nicely for me.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
